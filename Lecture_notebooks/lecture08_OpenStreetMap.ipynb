    "OSMnx is a great library for downloading and working with OSM data. The 'nx' in OSMnx comes from [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/index.html) and tells us that OSMnx is especially great for accessing and analyzing street network data.\n",

    "You can configure OSMnx `ox.settings` See the [documentation](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/osmnx.html?highlight=settings#module-osmnx.settings) for the settings you can configure. For example, by default OSMnx caches all server responses to prevent repeatedly hitting the server for the same query every time you run it. This both makes our code faster on subsequent runs and helps us be a \"good user\". But you can turn caching off (or back on again) with the `use_cache` parameter. Any parameters not passed to the config function are (re-)set to their original default values whenever you call it. If you are re-loading data for an analysis over a long time period, it can be a good idea to turn cacheing of, to avoid getting old outdated data.\n"

This also means that one-way streets are honored as one-way and you cannot travel the wrong direction down them. Thus, the 750m takes into account only those nodes you can reach within 750m while only traveling in the allowed direction of the street. Instead (below), we can specify `network_type='walk'` to build a street network only of paths that walking is allowed on. This also makes every path bi-directional in the directed network, because you can walk in either direction on the sidewalk of a one-way street. Thus, the 750m now takes into account those nodes you can reach within 750m while traveling in either direction (even if it's a one-way street)."

    "## 2.3 Cleaning up the periphery of the network\n",
    "\n",
    "This step is related to the network simplification. OSMnx by default (with clean_periphery parameter equal to True) buffers the area you request by 0.5km, and then retrieves the street network within this larger, buffered area. Then it simplifies the topology so that nodes represent intersections of streets (rather than including all the interstitial OSM nodes). Then it calculates the (undirected) degree of each node in this larger network. Next it truncates this network by the actual area you requested (either by bounding box, or by polygon). Finally it saves a dictionary of node degree values as a graph attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has two primary benefits. First, it cleans up stray false edges around the periphery. If clean_periphery=False, peripheral non-intersection nodes within the requested area appear to be cul-de-sacs, as the rest of the edge leading to an intersection outside the area is ignored. If clean_periphery=True, the larger graph is first created, allowing simplification of such edges to their true intersections, allowing their entirety to be pruned after truncating down to the actual requested area. Second, it gives accurate node degrees by both a) counting node neighbors even if they fall outside the retained network (so you don't claim a degree-4 node is degree-2 because only 2 of its neighbors lie within the area), and b) not counting all those stray false edges' terminus nodes as cul-de-sacs that otherwise grossly inflate the count of nodes with degree=1, even though these nodes are really just interstitial nodes in the middle of a chopped-off street segment between intersections.\n",

    "OSMnx is great for smaller areas, but not efficient enough if you want to get e.g. a street network for an entire country or region. There are many other, faster ways of accessing OSM data, one of them is [pyrosm](https://pyrosm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basics.html#read-street-networks). The pyrosm library is still fairly new and might have some bugs, but it is much more efficient than OSMnx and also allows for more [custom filters](https://pyrosm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/custom_filter.html)."
